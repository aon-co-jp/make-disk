A cross-platform (Rust + Tauri) GUI for burning CD/DVD/Blu-ray and converting audio/video.
One codebase; only the installers differ per OS.

## Latest version: v0.1.30

Get it from the [latest release](https://github.com/aon-co-jp/make-disk/releases/latest). Every file name carries the same version.

| Platform | File |
|---|---|
| Windows | `make-disk_0.1.30_x64-setup.exe` (recommended), `make-disk_0.1.30_x64_en-US.msi` |
| macOS | `make-disk_0.1.30_aarch64.dmg` (Apple Silicon), `make-disk_0.1.30_x64.dmg` (Intel) |
| Linux | `make-disk_0.1.30_amd64.deb`, `make-disk_0.1.30_amd64.AppImage`, `make-disk-0.1.30-1.x86_64.rpm` |
| Android | `make-disk_0.1.30_android-universal.apk` (unsigned, sideload) |

On Windows the default install folder is `%LOCALAPPDATA%\open-easy-web\make-disk` (updates from the old layout are moved automatically).

## Features

- **I/O**: pick multiple sources (audio/video/PDF) and an output folder; convert, build ISO images and burn
  discs at once (multiple formats, files and disc types run asynchronously in parallel).
- **Audio**: MP3 / WAV / FLAC / AAC / OGG / **Opus** / **AC-3 / E-AC-3 (5.1–7.1)** /
  **DSD64·128·256·512·1024 (DSF)**. ffmpeg cannot write DSD, so PCM→1-bit delta-sigma modulation
  (5th order, per-channel threads) and DSF writing are implemented in Rust and verified by round-tripping through ffmpeg's DSF decoder.
- **Video**: MP4 / MKV / AVI / MOV / WebM / **AV1** (libsvtav1 preferred, libaom fallback) /
  **HEVC 10-bit (HDR10)** / **lossless stream copy** (keeps Dolby Vision, Atmos, 5.1/7.1 surround).
  Resolution (720x480 up to 8K, PAL, custom, AI-optimized) and FPS (24/30/60/120, custom) are selectable;
  choices narrow by disc direction (BD→DVD: standard DVD resolution or Full HD; DVD→BD: Full HD or 4K).
- **High-resolution PCM (for R-2R / multi-bit DACs)**: 352.8 kHz / 384 kHz (24- and 32-bit) and 705.6 kHz / 768 kHz (32-bit) WAV, using the best
  available resampler (soxr, else a high-precision swresample setup) with TPDF dither. Measured SNR against an exact reference sine:
  352.8 kHz/24-bit = 141.2 dB, 384 kHz/32-bit = 150.2 dB. When DSD is created, no PCM is written alongside it
  (players convert DSD to PCM automatically on hardware without DSD, so PCM would only waste space). Measured DSD round-trip SNR: DSD64 = 99.6 dB, DSD128 = 132.4 dB.
- **AI super-resolution (video) and frame interpolation**: Real-ESRGAN (MIT) as an on-demand plugin (upconvert DVD 1-2 layer -> Blu-ray 1-4 layer, Full HD / 4K).
  **It benchmarks this PC's CPU and GPU and automatically picks the fastest of CPU-only / GPU-only / both** (our own Rust CPU build uses AVX2+FMA; output PSNR 42-57 dB against the official GPU build).
  Interlace/telecine auto-detection, black-bar crop and restore, skipping the AI on black/still frames, cancel and resume, and remaining-time display.
  **4K / 120 FPS** uses RIFE frame interpolation (rife-ncnn-vulkan, MIT; only ~12 MB fetched by range requests), and "Predict fit" tells you beforehand whether it fits the disc.
- **AI bandwidth extension (experimental)**: fills in the missing highs of band-limited audio with a trained model (LavaSR, Apache-2.0, run by pure-Rust tract, ~56 MB fetched on first use).
  **The existing band is never modified**, and the generated highs are capped by an extrapolation of the input envelope (the raw model output worsened music, hence this design).
  Measured (music band-limited at 8/12 kHz): LSD in the band with ground truth 3.4→1.5 and 2.7→1.6, low band unchanged. It is synthesis, not restoration, and does nothing for sources that are not band-limited.
- **AI noise reduction**: bundles a real trained neural network (RNNoise), verified with the real model. It is trained mostly on speech, so the effect on music is modest.
- **Bitrate / capacity**: fixed, auto from disc capacity, and a "maximum quality" mode (lossless WAV + ISO when no format is chosen).
  Auto bitrate is capped at the source bitrate, and audio-only outputs correctly use `-b:a`.
- **Cutting the source**: answer YES/NO to "Cut by size?" and "Cut by time?" (mutually exclusive, exactly one is YES; size is the default).
  Post-processing checkboxes: "Fill the disc" (CD / DVD 1–2 layer / Blu-ray 1–4 layer) and "AI auto-cut" (silence detection).
- **Playback-standard limits**: shows the maximum kHz, bit depth and bitrate of CD / DVD-Video / DVD-Audio / Blu-ray / Ultra HD Blu-ray / PC only,
  and converts to fit the chosen one (sources already below the limit are left as is; no upsampling).
- **Upconvert and fill the disc**: pick one of DVD 1–2 layer / Blu-ray 1–4 layer and Full HD or 4K; the bitrate that fills the disc is computed from the total length (audio subtracted) and hit precisely with 2-pass encoding (measured ~96–99% of the target, never over). It stops at the ceiling beyond which quality no longer improves (Full HD 40 Mbps, 4K 100 Mbps).
- **Fast extract of only the part you need**: even from a 5-hour source, set the start and end of the part you want (e.g. 60 or 10 minutes) and only that part is read and processed (measured: 10 minutes from the 2-hour mark of a 3h33m MP4 to WAV in ~1 s, 60 minutes in ~5 s).
- **Find with AI (aruaru-llm)**: describe what you want and it searches the subtitles (or a transcription) for a matching range and fills in the extract start/end, offering 3 options. It uses what is said, not what is shown. Re-encoding after an extract uses the GPU hardware encoder (or a speed-first setting chosen from open-cpu).
- **Editing**: multi-range cutting (choose the file in section 8 and set ranges while previewing the video/audio), concatenating files,
  equal-interval / size-based splitting (the remainder is auto-fitted to fill the disc).
- **PDF**: spread images (right/left binding, up to 4K) and bulk binding-direction conversion (page order reversal).
- **Burning (Windows)**: auto-detects optical drives, builds ISOs with IMAPI2 (keeps Japanese filenames) and burns.
  Verified on real hardware (BD-RE drive + CD-R): a 3.5-hour video → disc-filling audio → ISO → burn succeeded.
- **Other**: automatic update check on launch (bilingual dialog); versioned rs-ffmpeg / rs-xorriso plugins (an identical version is not overwritten).

## Not supported / limitations (honest disclosure)

- **Circumventing copy protection (CSS/AACS, etc.) is not implemented** (it can be illegal). Unprotected discs only.
- **Newly creating Dolby Vision / Atmos / Dolby Cinema / IMAX / 4DX is not possible** (licensed formats). Only preservation (stream copy) and compatible lower formats.
- **AI video super-resolution is very slow** (per 720x480 frame, measured on this PC: ~1.3 s on a 32-thread AVX2 CPU, ~2.8 s on a GT 730 GPU, both together ~1.3x faster; a feature film can take days).
  "Estimate" shows the expected time. Skipping still frames mainly saves compute time and has little effect on disc capacity. open-cuda has no GPU convolution, so the AI math runs on our own CPU kernel and Vulkan (NCNN).
  **RIFE interpolation is an approximation**: fast motion and scene cuts can show ghosting or warping, and it is not real 120 fps footage. It is very slow at 4K and temporarily uses several GB.
  On the GT 730, RIFE produced black frames with default settings, so it runs with `-j 1:1:1` and outputs are checked; broken segments are replaced by frame repetition. The general model (realesr-general-x4v3) is not bundled yet (live action also uses the fast model).
  **Audio AI bandwidth extension is experimental** (synthesis, no guarantee of perceptual quality). The "AI-optimized" resolution/FPS options are simple heuristics, not AI super-resolution.
- DSD files are huge (per stereo minute: DSD64 ≈ 42 MB … DSD1024 ≈ 678 MB) and are DSF files, not a Super Audio CD disc.
- Full HD on a DVD is outside the DVD-Video standard (max 720x480/576); set-top DVD players do not downscale it automatically, so it may not play.
- Upconversion restores detail with AI when "Use AI super-resolution" is on, and is plain interpolation when off. Video bitrate stops at 40 Mbps (Full HD) / 100 Mbps (4K), beyond which quality does not improve, and some disc space is then left free.
- "Find with AI" only uses what is said (subtitles/speech), not what is shown. Music-only videos (auto-captions like `[Music]`) cannot be searched by content.
- Burning on Linux/macOS relies on real xorriso (not bundled). Discs are written as data discs (audio CD / CD-DA burning is unsupported).
- iOS is unsupported (no test device).

## External dependencies

The Windows/Linux installers bundle ffmpeg/ffprobe and rs-ffmpeg/rs-xorriso (see `src-tauri/src/engine/sidecar.rs` and `plugins.rs`);
if absent, the tools on `PATH` are used. macOS ffmpeg and real xorriso are not bundled.

## Development

```bash
npm install
npm run tauri dev
cd src-tauri && cargo test --lib -- --test-threads=1
```
